## âš  WARNING

- We cannot guarantee that these features will be available.
- When archiving someone else's Twitter, please obtain their permission first.
- The structure of the generated data is still being adjusted, and the current results may not be available in viewer.

## Known issues
- Unable to crawl most of the retweets.
- Unable to crawl tweets marked as sensitive content (TODO login can solve).
- Unable to crawl copyrighted media files in some region.
- Some videos are damaged, which is normal. Downloading the corresponding m3u8 will result in a lower quality version. 
- Unable to crawl tweets from protected/banned/deleted users. 
- The rate limit status after logging in will follow the account rather than the guest token (TODO not implemented yet).

## Features

- Tweets and replies can be searched anonymously, not included most retweets.
- Polls
- Avatar, banner, photos and videos.
- Following and followers list (optional)

## TODO

- Incremental update tweets/followers/following list

## Init

  ```shell
  #bash
  bash init.sh <screen_name> # like 'twitter'
  #or powershell
